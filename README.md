# FirefoxProfileCreator
Creates Firefox Profiles

YOU NEED VISUAL STUDIO FOR THIS TO WORK

This Program creates firefox profiles via replicating human input.
Unless you are on the exact same setup as me you will HAVE to change some variables such as mouse coordinates, make sure that you do not move the firefox profile window so that it lauches in the same spot every time so you can consistanly make new profiles.

if you have a slow computer, you might need to change the sleep values x2 dont change the ones after line 202. you will have to go thourgh the sleep() above line 202 yourself Also dont touch lines 179 - 192. 

It is suggested that you use the built in cursor debug so you can see where the cursor needs to click.

You can change where they click on lines 94 - 105 and the name of the accounts on line 112 with instuctions on line 111.

If you want to add more you will need a basic understanding of c++.

you also need to build yourself in visual studio.
